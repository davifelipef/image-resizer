# Image Resizer
A simple script that resizes an image by % (400 by default, but can be edited) and converts it to the .bmp format.

## Use case
This script was created specifically to resize character spritesheets, so they can still be used as characters where a bigger size is required.

## How to use it
Put the image you wish to resize in the input folder, then run the script. The resized image will be created in the output folder.
